tone: navy
layout:
  hero: title + one-liner + single CTA to site + small throughput line
  body: left narrative “About the studio”; right “Weekly rhythm” cards (keep existing steps), no long pill cloud
requirements:
- Replace earlier chip cloud with a concise throughput line: “~4 shorts/day • ~2 long-form/week • 24–48h turnaround”.
- Left narrative must plainly state: clients send footage; output is platform-ready Reels/Shorts/TikToks with correct ratios and clear naming.
- Keep right column steps; rename heading to “Weekly rhythm”; remove vertical rail/spine.

Copy (left narrative):
I started editing years ago and got obsessed with keeping attention. That grew a TikTok and taught me how hooks, pacing, and naming drive retention. Today it’s a calm, repeatable studio on the side: clients outline the week in one call, I set direction and naming, two editors take parallel passes, and we iterate daily. We turn client footage into platform-ready Reels/Shorts/TikToks—proper ratios/specs and clear naming so posting is easy.
