  hero: title + one-liner + advisor line + chips
  body: top blurb, then side-by-side “Project approach” and “Semester plan (simplified)”
requirements:
- Remove Q1/M1/M2/M3 labels. Use simple named phases.
- Keep copy professional and readable for PM audiences; focus on approach and constraints.

Blurb:
Calibrated models, constrained explainer grounded in sleep science, transparent features, real-world validation, and feedback loops—the aim is evidence-backed guidance that’s actually usable.

Project approach:
- Clean and align raw wearables + journaling signals.
- Define features that reflect sleep structure and behaviors.
- Establish baselines (Ridge, XGBoost) with calibration.
- Validate against held-out nights and human-sensible error.

Semester plan (simplified):
- Data ready: curation, alignment, leakage checks.
- Baselines & calibration: Ridge/XGBoost, reliability checks.
- Validation: error bands, failure modes, human review.
- Constrained explainer: insights bounded by the literature.
