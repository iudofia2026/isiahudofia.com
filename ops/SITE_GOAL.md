Title: Portfolio for Isiah Udofia — APM/RPM ready

Purpose:
- Present a crisp, professional, product-management-ready portfolio.
- Emphasize product sense, execution, and storytelling (problem → approach → results).
- Maintain accessibility, performance, and visual consistency (Yale-blue system).
- Only HTML/CSS/vanilla JS (no packages). Netlify-friendly.

Scope (current iteration):
- Keep global site structure and look (see live site: isiahudofia.com).
- **Only** upgrade the three individual project pages’ quality (HTML/CSS/JS), not the rest:
  /basic-site/projects/discord.html
  /basic-site/projects/zen-video-agency.html
  /basic-site/projects/thesis-ml.html

PM signal requirements:
- Clear problem statements, constraints, hypotheses, tradeoffs.
- Results framed with tangible outcomes (no fake metrics).
- Next steps and learnings.
- Obvious, tasteful CTAs (Live demo, Repo if applicable, Contact).
